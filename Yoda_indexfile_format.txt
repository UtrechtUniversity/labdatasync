Yoda vault index file format
----------------------------

General characteristics:
- ascii text file, one line for each file entry
- filename is derived from name of the Yoda vault e.g. 'grp-vault-youth.txt'
- line ending format is Linux based (though tools that use this file should be tolerant)


Each line consists of the following information:
<hashtype> <whitespace> <hash> <whitespace> <filesize> <optional_pathname>

Lines that start with the '#' hashtag character should be ignored


where:

<hashtype>          =  'sha2' or 'md5' (without the quotes)
                      NB: 
                      1) hashtype is determined by iRODS server and new types could be added in the future
                      2) the hash string encoding varies per hashtype, current encodings are:
                      md5:  hex encoded      should match with Linux: md5sum <file>
                      sha2: base64 encoded   should match with Linux: sha256sum <file> | xxd -r -p | base64
<whitespace>        = one or more characters consisting of space, tabs
<hash>              = hex representation of the hash of a data object 
                      e.g.   '106995d6626c2bceef429edd9819ff07' (without the quotes) 
<filesize>          = integer number that depicts size of file in bytes
<optional_pathname> = <whitespace> <pathname>
                      NB: the <optional_pathname> component is optional 
<pathname>          = arbitrary characters to depict the pathname of the data object
                      NB: For confidentiality reasons the Yoda index file will NOT include the pathname
